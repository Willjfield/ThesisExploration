        <div id="intro">Around the world, a small but dedicated group of amateur astronomers track undocumented satellites using mainly consumer telescopes and stopwatches. These satellites include everything from spacecraft on highly classified missions launched by the National Reconnaisance Office to large pieces of debris. The following are real-time visualizations of the altitude of these spacecraft above the horizon at your current location, as well as a cylindrical and polar map so that you can spot them yourself. Learn more about amateur satellite tracking at the <a href="http://www.satobs.org/">Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page</a><div id="close">close</div></div>
