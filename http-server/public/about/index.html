			Does technology alienate us from the wonder of scientific discovery?<br><br>For the first time in the history of our planet, we can send our bodies and our machines into previously unreachable places. Places from the deepest parts of the ocean to interstallar space are no longer imagined places of myth but instead have become tangible, quantifiable, and analyzable. Ironically, at the same time, technology has become an opaic layer between us and these newly reached places. No where is this more evident than in astronomy.<br><br>We can discover thousands of planets outside of our solar system but the only direct evidence of them are faint dips in the light levels of their host stars. Through the openness of national space organizations, the public has unprecedented access to the bleeding edge of this exploration. Unfortunately, dispite their accessibility, many advanced tools and data sets seem impenetrably complex, so we are forced to rely on the interpretation of experts to appreciate them.<br><br>How is a non-trained scientist supposed to make sense of idiosyncratic scientific software, even if it is openly and freely accessible? If the software spits out a long series of numbers, what is to be made of them? Most importantly, how to we reconcile a print out of numbers with the mind blowing discoveries they represent?<br><br>explore.js is a modest attempt to bridge this gap. Through a relatively easy to use, well documented API and dataset developers can easily and quickly create compelling interactive visualizations to tell stories of space exploration.
